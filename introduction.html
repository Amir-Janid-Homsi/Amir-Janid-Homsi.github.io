      <p>I’m a Sophomore (junior by credits!) at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science with a focus in Systems and Networks. Can’t wait to learn more about computers in general, and in this class specifically web development.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I’m 19 and I’ve been tinkering with technology almost as far back as I can remember.</li>
        <li><b>Professional Background:</b> Unfortunately, I have not found a job in the industry just yet.</li>
        <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I already gave my academic background in my intro, but know I strive for A’s, and unfortunately I rarely if ever pass a math class with anything higher than a B.</li>
        <li><b>Background in this Subject:</b> The vast majority of what I know of HTML comes from experience using the “inspect element” feature in browsers to locate something in a webpage, be it a file or a link, in the last 10 years.</li>
        <li><b>Primary Work Computer:</b> My Laptop, dual-booting Linux and Windows. I primarily use Windows for Respondus Lockdown Browser, and basically nothing else. Something is very wrong with my laptop clock, which prevents Linux updates even when using WSL.</li>
        <li><b>Backup Work Computer &amp; Location Plan:</b>I will go to the UNCC Atkins Library and get a loaner laptop.</li>
        <li><b>Courses I’m Taking, &amp; Why:</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>ITSC 2181 - Introduction to Computer Systems:</b>It's a major graduation requirement,  but it's also likely very relevant to my concentration and I hope to enjoy my time in this class.</li>
          <li><b>ITSC 3688 - Computers &amp; Their Impact on Society:</b>It's also a major graduation requirement,  but it seems like an interesting class.</li>
          <li><b>ITIS 3135 - Front-End Web Application Development:</b>I think web development would be a good skill to have in the real world</li>
          <li><b>ITCS 3050 - Topics in Computer Science: Technical Interview Preparation 101:</b> It's definitely a credit filler class, but hopefully I get something out of it.</li>
          <li><b>MATH 2164 - Matrices &amp; Linear Algebra:</b>It's required couse that I dread. Math has been my weakpoint for the last 7 years.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Funny/Interesting item to remember me by:</b> I'm very curious, and when I am learning something, I ask a lot of questions.</li>
        <li><b>I’d also like to share:</b> I was born in New Jersey. All bread is MILES better up there.</li>
      </ul>
